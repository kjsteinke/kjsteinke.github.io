title: I added my Gift List!
---

I recently was asked by my son what I wanted for Father's day. It reminded me of all the times I asked the same question to my Father! :) It's an uphill task trying to get something for someone when they respond with "nothing"! So, I decided to use the Amazon Gift List area and make life easier for everyone...Pretty easy! Now I just give them, my link :)
